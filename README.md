# Integrated-Healthcare-Monitoring-System-for-PHCs-and-DDHS
The Integrated Healthcare Monitoring System is a digital platform that connects Primary Health Centres , Upgraded PHCs, and Sub-Centres with the Deputy Director of Health Services. It enables real-time tracking of doctor attendance, monitors healthcare services, and sends automated alerts for absenteeism to ensure efficient healthcare management .The system uses AI-powered facial recognition for doctor attendance tracking, ensuring secure and accurate verification. It collects real-time data from multiple healthcare centres, providing live updates on staff availability and medical services. If a doctor is absent, the system automatically notifies administrators to enable quick action and prevent service disruptions. The facial video recognition system is implemented using OpenCV with the Local Binary Patterns Histogram algorithm, which provides reliable identification even under varying lighting conditions and facial expressions . The platform is built using React.js for the front-end dashboard, Node.js for backend operations, and MongoDB for data storage. The React.js dashboard provides an interactive user-friendly interface to visualize PHCs status overview , doctor attendance, patient load, recent alert and healthcare reports in real time. By improving transparency, efficiency, and decision-making, this system helps healthcare administrators manage services more effectively. With the integration of modern technologies and automation, it ensures timely and efficient medical services, leading to better patient care and improved resource management.

The system provides an intelligent and centralized approach to monitoring doctor attendance and healthcare service delivery in real time across multiple healthcare centers, including Primary Health Centers and Sub-Centers. By utilizing AI-powered face recognition technology based on OpenCV’s Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm, the system automates the process of attendance tracking using live video feeds from strategically placed cameras. This automation greatly reduces the possibility of manual errors and decreases the administrative workload associated with traditional attendance methods. The system also features a user-friendly dashboard built with React.js, which offers the Deputy Director of Health Services (DDHS) and other authorized personnel instant access to attendance data, absenteeism patterns, and other critical healthcare metrics. On the backend, Node.js combined with a MySQL database provides a secure and efficient framework for storing and managing all attendance records and related information. Furthermore, the system incorporates automated absentee alerts that notify administrators promptly when doctors are absent beyond a specified time, enhancing overall responsiveness, transparency, and operational efficiency. Ultimately, this comprehensive solution improves healthcare governance by ensuring accurate monitoring, timely interventions, and smoother service delivery across all connected healthcare units.

**IMPLEMENTATION SETUP**

The implementation of the Integrated Healthcare Monitoring System is designed to function efficiently without relying on complex hardware or cloud services. Instead of traditional CCTV surveillance systems, IP-based web cameras are used to capture live video feeds for facial recognition. The system uses OpenCV’s LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histogram) algorithm for real-time identification and attendance marking of doctors. The user interface is developed using React.js, providing a seamless and dynamic dashboard for administrators. Data is stored in a locally hosted MySQL database, and alerts regarding doctor absenteeism are sent using the Twilio SMS gateway. This setup ensures cost-efficiency, real-time monitoring, and enhanced accountability in managing multiple healthcare centers.

**1. VIDEO SURVEILLANCE USING IP WEB CAMERAS**

The system utilizes IP web cameras as an alternative to traditional surveillance equipment to monitor healthcare centers. These cameras are capable of streaming live video feeds over the network, which are then processed by the face recognition module. IP web cameras are more affordable and flexible, requiring minimal setup while enabling remote access and real-time video transmission. This makes them ideal for monitoring multiple Primary Health Centers (PHCs), Upgraded PHCs, and Sub-Centers.

**2. REAL-TIME FACE RECOGNITION WITH OPENCV LBPH**
Face recognition is a critical component of the system, and it is implemented using OpenCV’s Local Binary Patterns Histograms (LBPH) algorithm. The algorithm captures facial features from the live video stream and compares them with the pre-stored facial data of registered doctors. If a match is found, the system automatically logs the attendance along with the date, time, and location. The LBPH algorithm is selected for its robustness against lighting variations and its ability to perform well in real-time scenarios with limited hardware resources.


**3. DYNAMIC FRONTEND WITH REACT.JS**
The user interface is built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building fast and interactive web applications. The frontend provides administrators with a real-time dashboard displaying doctor attendance logs, healthcare center status, and alerts. It features a clean and intuitive design that allows easy navigation and quick access to attendance data and alerts. This ensures that the Deputy Director of Health Services (DDHS) can monitor multiple centers effectively from a single interface.

**4. BACKEND SERVER USING NODE.JS AND EXPRESS.JS**
The backend server is developed using Node.js and the Express.js framework, which together provide a scalable and efficient platform for handling HTTP requests, managing user sessions, and integrating with external APIs. The server manages communication between the frontend, video recognition module, and MySQL database. It is responsible for processing login credentials, managing doctor records, saving attendance logs, and triggering alert mechanisms based on recognition results.

**5. MYSQL DATABASE FOR LOCAL DATA STORAGE**
For data storage, the system uses MySQL, a reliable relational database management system. The database stores structured data, including doctor profiles, camera locations, attendance logs, and alert records. By avoiding cloud storage, the system ensures full control over data privacy and security. The database schema is optimized for fast retrieval of real-time data, supporting quick updates to the frontend dashboard and backend processing logic.

**6. TWILIO INTEGRATION FOR AUTOMATED ABSENTEE ALERTS**
Twilio is integrated into the backend to send real-time SMS alerts to the DDHS or other concerned authorities if a doctor is not detected at a specified time or location. Once the face recognition module identifies a doctor's absence, an automated process is triggered to send a notification using the Twilio API. This feature enhances responsiveness and accountability by ensuring that absenteeism is not only recorded but also acted upon immediately.
